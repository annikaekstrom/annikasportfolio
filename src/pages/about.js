                <p>I am currently studying web development at Technigo.
                    In 12 weeks I have been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                    React and Node. It is an intense program and every day has
                    been filled with new information, individual assignments
                    and group assignment. <br /> Moreover, I have a Master
                    in Business from Link√∂ping University.

                mainly working with customer relationships, customer service,
                project management and marketing. I am used to work in

                <p>I see myself as an adventurous and
                  a social person who loves to meet new people.
                  I love travelling and I have seen a lot of places in the
                  world when I have been working, studying and just exploring
                  places abroad. In the summer I like to play golf and in the
                  winter I prefer skiing :)
